\chapter*{Abstract}

This thesis aims to discuss a number of possibilities for automatic connection between \vpp\ and \jml, in both directions. The project aims at identifying  the possible subsets for which this connection is possible, as well as describing in detail all the limitations encountered. 

It is believed that such a connection can enable \vpp\ to act as a front-end for contract-based programming, the usage of tool support from both sides and can allow different teaching perspectives with respect to formal methods. 

The development of a prototype proof-of-concept implementation of this bi-directional mapper based on its possible theoretical limitations is the mail goal of this work.
