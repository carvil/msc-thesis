\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

There are a number of persons whom I would like to thank the support and commitment. First of all, I would like to thank Professor Peter Gorm Larsen for the professional and personal support he constantly gave me and for his constant commitment in making me improve my skills. His dedication to his students is remarkable and he is a source of energy and inspiration for the ones that work with him.

I would like to thank my family for their support when I decided to come to Denmark, and for all their help during the time I spent here.

I would also like to thank Professor Lu\'{i}s Barbosa for his support and advice before comming to Denmark.

Finally, I would like to dedicate this thesis to Adriana Santos. I am absolutely sure that without her support, energy, patience, care and good mood, none of this would be possible. She gave me strengths when I most needed and she had patience when I least deserve it. Together we overcome difficulties and we faced challenges. For all this and much more, Thank You!
